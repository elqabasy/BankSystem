# Online Banking System - C++ Project

## Project Overview

This is a **C++**-based **Online Banking System** designed to simulate real-world banking operations, such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, and transferring money between accounts. The project serves as part of the **Brainwave Matrix Solution Internship Task #2** and aims to build a secure, scalable, and efficient banking system.

The system is structured in a modular way, allowing easy maintenance and future extensions. The project covers key concepts in **object-oriented design**, **system architecture**, and **data security**, while ensuring that the operations of the bank are efficient, accurate, and secure.

## Key Features

- **Account Management:** Users can create, update, and delete accounts.
- **Deposits & Withdrawals:** Allows users to deposit and withdraw money from their accounts.
- **Money Transfer:** Users can transfer money between different accounts within the system.
- **Transaction History:** Keep track of all financial transactions for each account.
- **Security:** Implementation of secure transactions and user data protection.
- **Real-time Operations:** All operations, such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, are processed in real-time.

## System Components

1. **Account Management:** Manages account creation, account deletion, and updating account details.
2. **Transaction Management:** Handles deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and transaction history.
3. **Data Storage:** Stores account details and transaction history securely.
4. **Security:** Implements necessary security features to protect user data and transactions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Design Principles:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Modular Design
- **Security:** Basic security measures to ensure the protection of user data (like encrypted transaction processing).
- **System Design:** Use of UML diagrams and design patterns for effective system architecture.
